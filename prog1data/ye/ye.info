3. Number of Instances:  1462 for the Yeast dataset.

4. Number of Attributes.
         for Yeast dataset:   9 ( 8 predictive, 1 name )
	     
5. Attribute Information.
  1.  Sequence Name: Accession number for the SWISS-PROT database (converted to numeric ID)
  2.  mcg: McGeoch's method for signal sequence recognition.
  3.  gvh: von Heijne's method for signal sequence recognition.
  4.  alm: Score of the ALOM membrane spanning region prediction program.
  5.  mit: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of
	   the N-terminal region (20 residues long) of mitochondrial and 
           non-mitochondrial proteins.
  6.  erl: Presence of "HDEL" substring (thought to act as a signal for
	   retention in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen). Binary attribute.
  7.  pox: Peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminus.
  8.  vac: Score of discriminant analysis of the amino acid content of
           vacuolar and extracellular proteins.
  9.  nuc: Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals
	   of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins.


6. Missing Attribute Values: None.


7. Class Distribution. The class is the localization site. Please see Nakai &
		       Kanehisa referenced above for more details.
  CYT (cytosolic or cytoskeletal)                    463
  NUC (nuclear)                                      429
  MIT (mitochondrial)                                244
  ME3 (membrane protein, no N-terminal signal)       163
  ME2 (membrane protein, uncleaved signal)            51
  ME1 (membrane protein, cleaved signal)              44
  EXC (extracellular)                                 37
  VAC (vacuolar)                                      30
  POX (peroxisomal)                                   20
  ERL (endoplasmic reticulum lumen)                    5
  To convert this to binary classification, we treat the CYT examples as 
  positive and the rest as negative examples.
