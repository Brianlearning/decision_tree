Decision Tree algorithm implemented in Python.

Requires Python 2.6

To run, type "python dtree.py <args>".

The code is pretty sparsely documented right now, but I believe it is understandable with a rudimentary understanding of Python.
Let me know if you have any problems debugging or running the code.
